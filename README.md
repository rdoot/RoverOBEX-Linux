RoverOBEX-Linux
===============

OBEX client for rover to HTTP server running on linux.

This is more of a hack than something that is actually useful. The script mounts the phone on to the HTTP server root. You still need a server like apache or nginx to stream the video. Also you need the J2ME client for this to work.

To change the settings all one needs to do is edit the variables in the script. You will also need to know your phone's bluetooth MAC.
